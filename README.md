# Log Plus

Log Plus is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to simplify and enhance the process of navigating log files. Spending countless hours searching through logs, I often found myself repeatedly looking for the same patterns in different files. This inspired me to create **Log Plus**â€”a tool to make working with log files more efficient and less tedious.

## Features

Log Plus comes packed with features to streamline your workflow:

- **Highlight log patterns with custom colors**  
  Quickly identify key log entries by applying custom highlight rules.

- **Manage highlight rules**  
  Easily add, edit, or delete highlight rules through an intuitive interface.

- **Export and import highlight rules**  
  Save your highlight configurations for reuse or share them with your team.

- **Convert files to a "-plus" version**  
  Safeguard your original log files by creating editable copies with a "-plus" suffix.

- **Revert changes made to "-plus" files**  
  Quickly undo modifications to "-plus" files to restore their original state.

## Installation
